                <p>In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked as the world's number one. It
                    was an incredible achievement by any standard made even more remarkable by the fact that he did this
                    during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport's history, competing against the
                    likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to name just a few. Yet five years
                    previously, he had been regarded as a talented outsider who entered but never won the major
                    tournaments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of the changes that account for this transformation, one was visible and widely publicised: in 2011,
                    Murray invited former number one player Ivan Lendl onto his coaching team a valuable addition that
                    had a visible impact on the player's playing style. Another change was so subtle as to pass more or
                    less unnoticed. Like many players, Murray has long preferred a racket that consists of two types of
                    string: one for the mains (verticals) and another for the crosses (horizontals). While he continued
                    to use natural string in the crosses, in 2012 he switched to a synthetic string for the mains. A
                    small change, perhaps, but its importance should not be underestimated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The modification that Murray made is just one of a number of options available to players looking to
                    tweak their rackets in order to improve their games. "Touring professionals have their rackets
                    customised to their specific needs,' says Colin Triplow, a UK-based professional racket stringer.
                    "It's a highly important part of performance maximisation. Consequently, the specific rackets used
                    by the world's elite are not actually readily available to the public; rather, each racket is
                    individually made to suit the player who uses it. Take the US professional tennis players Mike and
                    Bob Bryan, for example: "We're very particular with our racket specifications, they say. 'All our
                    rackets are sent from our manufacturer to Tampa, Florida, where our frames go through a thorough
                    customisation process. They explain how they have adjusted not only racket length, but even
                    experimented with different kinds of paint. The rackets they use now weigh more than the average
                    model and also have a denser string pattern (i.e. more crosses and mains).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The primary reason for these modifications is simple: as the line between winning and losing becomes
                    thinner and thinner, even these slight changes become more and more important. As a result, players
                    and their teams are becoming increasingly creative with the modifications to their rackets as they
                    look to maximise their competitive advantage. Racket modifications mainly date back to the 1970s,
                    when the amateur German tennis player Werner Fischer started playing with the so-called
                    spaghetti-strung racket. It created a string bed that generated so much topspin that it was quickly
                    banned by the International Tennis Federation. However, within a decade or two, racket modification
                    became a regularity. Today it is, in many ways, an aspect of the game that is equal in significance
                    to nutrition or training.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modifications can be divided into two categories: those to the string bed and those to the racket
                    frame. The former is far more common than the latter: the choice of the strings and the tension with
                    which they are installed is something that nearly all professional players experiment with. They
                    will continually change it depending on various factors including the court surface, climatic
                    conditions, and game styles. Some will even change it depending on how they feel at the time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At one time, all tennis rackets were strung with natural gut made from the outer layer of sheep or
                    cow intestines. This all changed in the early 1990s with the development of synthetic strings that
                    were cheaper and more durable. They are made from three materials: nylon (relatively durable and
                    affordable), Kevlar (too stiff to be used alone) or co-polyester (polyester combined with additives
                    that enhance its performance). Even so, many professional players continue to use a 'hybrid set-up',
                    where a combination of both synthetic and natural strings are used.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of the synthetics, co-polyester is by far the most widely used. It's a perfect fit for the style of
                    tennis now played, where players tend to battle it out from the back of the court rather than coming
                    to the net. Studies indicate that the average spin from a co-polyester string is 25% greater than
                    that from natural string or other synthetics. In a sense, the development of co-polyester strings
                    has revolutionised the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, many players go beyond these basic adjustments to the strings and make changes to the
                    racket frame itself. For example, much of the serving power of US professional player Pete Sampras
                    was attributed to the addition of four to five lead weights onto his rackets, and today many
                    professionals have the weight adjusted during the manufacturing process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other changes to the frame involve the handle. Players have individual preferences for the shape of
                    the handle and some will have the handle of one racket moulded onto the frame of a different racket.
                    Other players make different changes. The professional Portuguese player Gonçalo Oliveira replaced
                    the original grips of his rackets with something thinner because they had previously felt
                    uncomfortable to hold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Racket customisation and modification have pushed the standards of the game to greater levels that
                    few could have anticipated in the days of natural strings and heavy, wooden frames, and it's
                    exciting to see what further developments there will be in the future.</p>
